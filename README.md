# 8-minute-workout

# Welcome to the 8 minute workout where you can workout for 8 minutes!

> Full disclosure, I think this will be longer than 8 minutes.

## How it works:

### Click the 'Start' button to begin the workout.

### You will see the exercise you are assigned and you will have 10 seconds to get ready.

### Once the 10 seconds are up, the name of the exercise will still be on the screen, but the countdown will change to 45 seconds.

### As the 45 seconds countdown and it reaches 0, you will see another countdown of 15 seconds for you to rest.

### After the rest period, the 10 second prep time, 45 second exercise, and 15 second rest cycle will continue until you finish all 8 exercises.

- Note: Stretch and cooldown exercises are not included.

## Materials needed:

- Water
- Free weights (optional with workouts)

# Not DRY --- work through it and come back
